## Markov Chain — Predicting What Comes Next

A Markov chain is a simple way to model decisions or events where what happens next depends only on the current state — not the full history.

It builds a map of possible next steps, weighted by how often they happen. Once trained, you can ask “what’s likely to come after this?” and it’ll answer based on what it’s seen before.
Example Use Cases

    Text generation: Given a word or phrase, predict the next likely word.

    Game AI: NPC movement or attack patterns that feel dynamic but learned.

    User behavior modeling: Predict what screen or action a user might do next.

    Procedural content: Generate terrain, music, or missions based on past structure.

How It Works (Simple)

    Feed it sequences: ["walk", "run", "jump", "walk", "run", "walk", "jump"]

    It counts transitions:
    "walk" → "run" (2), "jump" (1)

    You ask: “what comes after ‘walk’?”

    It picks based on weights — here, "run" is twice as likely as "jump".

### Simplified System, Smart Behavior

Markov chains are great for building approximations of complex behavior with minimal state. You don’t simulate the entire world — just the immediate context and likely next steps. Perfect when you need lightweight, reactive systems.

In modern game AI, you can track player or NPC actions over time and build predictive chains that adjust dynamically. This enables AI that evolves based on how the user plays — without needing deep learning or heavy systems.
### Formalizing Predictions

To go beyond basic state-to-state predictions, you can parameterize your chain:

    Use variables (e.g. difficulty, player skill, environment) to influence transition weights.

    Either:

        Maintain multiple chains for different conditions (e.g. easy/hard),

        Or have a single chain with dynamic weight functions depending on context.

Which one you pick depends on how discrete your conditions are. For complex, fluid systems, dynamic functions usually scale better.
